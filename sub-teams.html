      <h2>Sub-teams</h2>
      <p>
        SGD divides into subteams to stay productive. We believe specializing in certain jobs will help us be efficient and enjoy what we are interested in.<br>
        There are three different subteams: <strong>Coding team</strong>, <strong>Concept-Design team</strong>, and <strong>Design team</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Coding team</h3></li>
        <ul><li>Do you enjoy coding? If so, then coding team is for you! Using Unity, members of the coding team write script using C# to create the vital elements of our game.</li></ul>
        <li><h3>Concept-Design team</h3></li>
        <ul><li>Do you have a passion for creativity? If so, then design team is the choice for you! Members of the design team use Blender to create 3D models of our characters and other important game objects, as well as traditional drawing methods to produce concept art.</li></ul>
        <li><h3>Design team</h3></li>
        <ul><li>Not into coding or 3D design, but have a creative streak? If so, then concept design team is for you! Members of the concept design team work together to create the premise of our game. Members envision and design game mechanics, characters, and countless other game features.</li></ul>
