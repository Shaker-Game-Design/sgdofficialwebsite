      <h2>Shaker Game Design team have following goals:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>Enjoy!</h3></li>
        <ul><li>Our goal is to work as a collaborative team to create our very own game from the ground up. However, the main goal is to have fun; we are making a game after all! Once our game is stable, we plan to release an <a href="" title="See our current progress" target="_blank">alpha version</a> to the popular game website, Steam.</li></ul>
        <li><h3>Productive!</h3></li>
        <ul><li>While our main goal is to have fun, it is also important that we are productive as a club. We have <a href="sub-teams.html" title="learn about the sub-teams" target="_blank">three sub-teams</a>: coding, design, and concept. Through specializing in certain jobs, we have the opportunity to work much more efficiently and productively.</li></ul>
        <li><h3>Donate!</h3></li>
        <ul>Part of the profits that we eventually earn from releasing our game will be donated. It is important that we give back to others!</ul>
